<h2>Target audience</h2>
<hr>
<p>First: I will talk about the younger audience. Their primairyly 23 to 35 probably want to hear aboput new casnio openings and fun attractions like the highroller. Having a plan rolls out the window with them.</p>
<p>Second:The older audience still enjoy the same things but at a slower place. This slower place means natural parks and casnios that cater to buffets and shows.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Younger looking for funn porbaly wants to know about the high attraction shows and high roller casinos.</li>
    <li>2. Older Probably is visting all the parks after their retirement. Wants to see show but is ok with smaller ones.</li>
    <li>3. Younger is going to all natunal parks in a year comes in only for the sites.</li>
    <li>4. Older wants to vist family and the shows. </li>
    <li>5. Older goes to the bakery's.</li>
